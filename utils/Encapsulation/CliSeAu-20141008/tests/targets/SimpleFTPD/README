Testing CliSeAu with simple-ftpd

(0) Check "config/paths.cfg" in the main directory (../../../) and
    configure the paths (to libraries) if necessary

(1) Run "ant" in the main directory (../../../)

(2) In this ("tests/targets/SimpleFTPD") directory, run the following to prepare

    # Download the sources of the FTP server implementation by
    # Jang Ho Hwang, running
    git clone git://github.com/rath/simple-ftpd.git impl
    patch -d impl -p1 < patches/permit-local-server-address.patch
    cd impl
    ant

(3) Run "ant SimpleFTPD" in the instantiations directory (../../instances/)

(4) In the tests directory (../../), run the following commands
    to build the encapsulated units for the Chinese Wall policy

    java -jar ../build/encaps.jar SimpleFTPD-ChineseWall.cfg network-local.cfg

    If this step does not work, it might help to first run
      ulimit -c unlimited
    before on some systems.

(5) In this ("tests/targets/SimpleFTPD") directory, run the following commands
    the setup the demo environment

    # In the following, <N> is the number of servers to
    # initialize (should be the same value as "numberOfUnits"
    # setting in "tests/SimpleFTPD-ChineseWall.cfg")
    bash data/mkprops.sh <N> data/ `pwd`/data

(6) Start the servers

    bash ./enc-server.sh "`seq <N>`"
    # type "exit<RETURN>" in this shell once you finished the following

(7) Start an FTP client of your choice to connect to one
    of the started servers (connect to "localhost",
    port 2020+<i> (for <i> in 1,...,<N>) with user name
    "auditor" and password "password").
