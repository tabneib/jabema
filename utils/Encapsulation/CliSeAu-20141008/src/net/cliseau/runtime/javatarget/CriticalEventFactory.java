/**
 * Factory for critical event objects.
 *
 * An instantiation (for Java targets) must provide an implementation of a
 * CriticalEventFactory. For each pointcut
 * <em>pointcut pcname(T1 p1, ..., Tn pn)</em>
 * declared for the instantiation, such an implementation must provide a method
 * <em>public static CriticalEvent pcname(T1 p1, ..., Tn pn);</em>. Note that
 * this requirement is currently not reflected in the declaration of the
 * CriticalEventFactory.
 *
 * In simple cases, the implementation of the CriticalEventFactory can at the
 * same time be an implementation of the CriticalEvent interface. However, care
 * has to be taken that the resulting derived classes do not refer to
 * target-specific datatypes which are known to the target program (and thereby
 * to the enforcer and interceptor) but not to the Coordinator. Otherwise the
 * de-serialization of received CriticalEvent streams by the Coordinator fails
 * with a NoClassDefFoundError.
 *
 * @see net.cliseau.runtime.javacor.CriticalEvent
 * @todo Later, a tool could be developed which, from a given pointcut
 *       specification file, generates a stub CriticalEventFactory for
 *       convenience of instantiators.
