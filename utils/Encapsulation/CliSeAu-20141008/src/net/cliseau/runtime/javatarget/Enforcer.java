/**
 * Interface for enforcer instantiations for Java target programs.
 *
 * Every enforcer instantiation for Java target programs must implement this
 * interface. An enforcer determines (based on a previously received enforcement
 * decision) the code to be performed instead of the intercepted critical event.
 *
 * Java targets are instrumented using AspectJ to include interceptor and
 * enforcer code at all join points matching one out of the given set of
 * pointcuts. For this, "around" advice are used which can make use of the
 * "proceed()" statement to run the intercepted critical event. The code of the
 * enforcer is therefore split into
 * <ul>
 * <li>code to be performed before the critical event,</li>
 * <li>code to be performed after the critical event, and</li>
 * <li>the decision whether to perform or suppress the execution of the critical
 * event itself,</li>
 * <li>code for computing a surrogate return value in case of a suppressed
 * critical event.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Obviously, if the critical event is suppressed, then the distinction of
 * "before" and "after" with respect to the critical event becomes meaningless.
 * However, for the sake of having only a single Enforcer interface, we do not
 * distinguish suppressing and permitting Enforcer classes.
 *
 * @see EnforcerFactory
 * @see net.cliseau.runtime.javacor.EnforcementDecision
 * @todo Simplify the interface to only a single method "run". See the
 *       documentation for details.
