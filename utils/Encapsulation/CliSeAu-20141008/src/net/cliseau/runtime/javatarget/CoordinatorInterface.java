/**
 * Interface to coordinators for interceptors and enforcers.
 *
 * This class provides an easy to use interface to the local coordinator. It is
 * meant to be used by interceptors and enforcers and abstracts away the details
 * of establishing a connection to the coordinator and sending/receiving data
 * objects (in a serialized form).
 *
 * The used communication paradigm is to not establish a single connection on
 * which the sending and receiving happens. Rather
 *  - a connection to the local coordinator is established for sending data only
 *    and closing the connection immediately afterwards;
 *  - an incoming connection from the local coordinator is awaited for receiving
 *    data.
 *
 * This follows the formal model of service automata which uses separate
 * channels for the communication between interceptor and coordinator and,
 * respectively, between enforcer and coordinator. Whether the chosen approach
 * is sufficiently generic for many target platforms and is yet efficient, this
 * still has to be evaluated. Any changes to the paradigm should, however, first
 * be performed in the Coordinator rather than the CoordinatorInterface, because
 * the latter is only concerned with Java target programs.
 *
 * @see Enforcer
 * @see net.cliseau.runtime.javacor.Coordinator
 * @todo Check whether it would make sense to merge send() and receive() to a
 *       single function since they are most likely used sequentially anyways.
