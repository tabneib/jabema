 * The LocalPolicyResponse is a base type for all types that can be returned
 * from a request to a local policy. Currently, this is supposed to be either an
 * EnforcementDecision or a DelegationLocPolReturn (which basically encapsulates
 * a DelegationReqResp together with a destination identifier).

 * Deriving descendant classes from LocalPolicyResponse for instantiation is not
 * intended. If you want custom local policy responses for an instantiation,
 * define descendant classes from EnforcementDecision and DelegationReqResp.
