/**
 * Data type for delegation requests and responses.
 *
 * This interface defines the data type which represents delegated requests and
 * responses. Such objects are transmitted between the coordinators of different
 * CliSeAu units. Local policies are supposed to return objects of this type
 * (encapsulated in DelegationLocPolReturn objects) whenever the result of a
 * call to the local policy is destined to a remote CliSeAu unit rather
 * than the local one.
 *
 * Currently, the interface does not impose any requirement on implementing
 * classes, i.e., the interface does not contain any methods.
 *
 * For instantiation, one may either define one class each for delegation
 * requests and for delegation responses which directly derive from
 * DelegationReqResp. Alternatively, one can also define a common descendant
 * class (which could, e.g., comprise fields for source and destination
 * identifier) and derive from this the actual delegation request and delegation
 * response classes.
 *

 * @see DelegationLocPolReturn
