	 * @param socket The ServerSocket on which to listen for incoming requests.
	 * @param bLocal Whether or not "socket" is the local server socket (true) or the remote one (false).
	 * @todo The logger code should finally only produce "debug" output if
	 *       a special flag is set.
	 * @todo Think about closing the connection for the incoming request only
	 *       *after* the request to the local policy. This would allow for
	 *       sending some kind of status code back to the sender, thereby
	 *       enabling error handling.
	 * @todo Check whether it is possible to avoid using 'instanceof' on the
	 *       LocalPolicy response 'resp' by instead calling a method on 'resp'
	 *       itself. Using 'instanceof' is bad programming practice.
	 * @todo Define a meaningful subclass of RuntimeException for the case that
	 *       the LocalPolicy returned an object of the wrong type (which is not a
	 *       subclass of EnforcementDecision or DelegationLocPolReturn).
	 * @todo Increase robustness of the Coordinator by meaningfully reacting to
	 *       exceptions and (a) requesting a retransmit from the sender on
	 *       reception of an invalid message; (b) retransmitting sent messages on
	 *       transmission failures.
