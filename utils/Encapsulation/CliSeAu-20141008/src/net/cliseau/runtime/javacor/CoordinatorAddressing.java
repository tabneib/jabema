/**
 * Encapsulate addressing pecularities between CliSeAu units and their components.
 *
 * This helps to avoid that the Coordinator has to deal with pecularities like
 * socket creation and managing internal and external addresses of CliSeAu units.
 * Objects of this class hide
 * <ol>
 * <li>addresses and their management and</li>
 * <li>the creation of server and client sockets</li>
 * </ol>
 * from the Coordinator implementation.
 *
 * This has the idea that potentially later the integration of, e.g., SSLSockets
 * for encryption is simpler than if this would all be entangled in the
 * Coordinator implementation.
