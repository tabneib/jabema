 * Barrier synchronization for the startup of CliSeAu units.

 * At the start of a CliSeAu instance, some synchronization is useful.
 * The barrier synchronization is used in order to start the coordinators of all
 * the CliSeAu units in the distributed system before the actual programs
 * belonging to them are executed. Under the assumption that CliSeAu units
 * never terminate, this ensures that whenever a program causes a critical event
 * that has to be delegated, then the delegate CliSeAu unit is already
 * running.
