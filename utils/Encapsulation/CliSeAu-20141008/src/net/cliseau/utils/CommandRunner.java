 * of running system commands requires that the output of the command is treated
 * by the calling Java program. That is, the command does not simply use the
 * standard output and input file descriptors of the calling program. In
 * consequence, the calling program cannot simply ignore the output of the
 * program, because then internal buffers would run full and cause the command
 * to wait indefinitely until the buffers become free again. Hence, this
 * convenience class provides variants of "exec()" which automatically forward
 * the command's output to the calling program's standard output streams.
