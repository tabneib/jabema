Here should go a version of Dominic Scheurer's datalog policy

Probably the code should be taken from the following directories:
 - implementation/Distributed Datalog Policies/Datalog for Service Automata (Distributed)/src/net/serviceautomata/datalog
 - implementation/Distributed Datalog Policies/JGitDistributed/inst/net/serviceautomata/jgit/

We also need a set of example instances for the FTP programs
or even for JGit - but somewhere else.
