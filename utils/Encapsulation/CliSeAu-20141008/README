CliSeAu
========

This file belongs to the code and documentation of CliSeAu.
Here you find only the basic information about the package.
See below about where to find further information.


Quick Setup (Linux)
------------------------

The following instructions assume that you obtained a file
 - CliSeAu-<date>.tar.gz

Run the following commands in bash:
  export CLISEAU=CliSeAu-<date>
  tar -xvzf $CLISEAU.tar.gz
  # install AspectJ
  # - download 'aspectj-<version>.jar' (from http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php)
  # - run 'java -jar aspectj-<version>.jar'
  # - follow the instruction of the GUI,
  #   specifying '$CLISEAU/libs/aspectj1.6' as the installation path
  #   (if you like to install AspectJ elsewhere, it also suffices to
  #    afterwards place a symbolic link in $CLISEAU/libs)
  cd $CLISEAU
  ant

Existing test targets and policies can now be used to see CliSeAu
implementation in action. For instructions on the tests, check

  tests/targets/SimpleFTPD/README
  tests/targets/AnomicFTPD/README


Contents and Directories
------------------------

 * config/paths.cfg

   A central configuration file for paths and libraries.

 * data/

   Contains auxiliary files for CliSeAu's composer. Currently, these
   are templates from which Java source files and AspectJ aspects are generated.

 * doc/

   Architecture and source code documentation.

 * src/

   Source code of the implementation

   * net/cliseau/

     This directory contains the main code files.

     * composer/

       Code for creating instantiations of CliSeAu.

     * lib/enforcer/

       Library of common enforcers for Java programs.

     * runtime/

       Code for Coordinator and Local Policy implementations in Java.
       Code for Interceptor and Enforcer for Java target nodes.
       Code for synchronization (currently, this is only the barrier
       implementation for the startup of CliSeAu instantiations).

     * utils/

       Miscellaneous smaller code parts.

   * test/cliseau/

     Code for testing the implementation

     * junit/

       Tests of the implementation, to be run by 'junit'.

     * inst/

       A simple CliSeAu instantiation for Java in order to test the
       code.

 * tests/

   This directory contains larger tests. See the README files contained in
   the subdirectories for more information on the tests.
