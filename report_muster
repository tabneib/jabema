		Number of samples: 	SAMPLES
		Number of measurements:	MEASUREMENTS
		Measurements in the steady state used for computing the average retTime: SteadyMEASUREMENT
		
	
	+ Content of the directories:
		./retTimes
			Each file stores the average retTime in the steady state of each sample.

		./plots/retTime
			Plot of (normalized) retTime of the first 30 samples. The Steady state is highlighted.
			In this plot we can clearly see the accuracy of the determining technique whose parameters were carefully adjusted.
	
		./plots/retTime_raw
			Plot of the raw observed retTime of the first 30 samples.

		./plots/other
			Plots of the intermediate data that is computed during applying the technique for determining
			the steady state. Here we also plot the first 30 samples.

	 	./capacity
			Plots and results of the estimation of timing side channel capacity.
